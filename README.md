place to test new tools 

#How to run.
1. git clone ...
2. npm install in the main folder
3. in another terminal open /public/ and run npm install
4. run: npm start in the main folder and in another console npm stat in /public/
5. Can check the graphql - koa server runing in 127.0.0.1:3000/graphiql
6. The react dev server will ask to start on separate port like 3001. When you agree a browser will open.

Keep in mind that this is POC the code and organization is messy.
